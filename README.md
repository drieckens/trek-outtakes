"Star Trek: The Outtake Missions" is a short and simple CLI dialogue game created to fulfill the requirements of a Codecademy portfolio project. It is set in the original "Star Trek" series and entails navigating the U.S.S. Enterprise to different planets in the style of a rudimentary "choose your own adventure" story. Trekkie reference gags abound.

The game is the capstone porject for Codecademy's Intro to Programming course in the Computer Science Career Path. The focus of the course is Python. My game demonstrates (I hope) a foundational understanding of object-oriented programming; its features include (inter alia):
  * defining a class and instantiating objects
  * lists and dictionaries
  * list modification methods
  * variables
  * functions
  * while loops with conditional logic
  * user input
  * error handling
